This program is designed to predict epigenetic alternation of genetic variants in non-coding regions of P. falciparum. To successfully run this model, the following package or software are required to be installed.

1.bedtools (>2.30.0)
2.tensorflow (2.4.1)
3.numpy (1.19.5)
4.bisect
5.pickle
6.json

Before runninge prediction model, please put the following files in the same folder
1. genome_2_tensor.py  
2. intergenic.SNP.dl.logRatio.list.hash.pickle
3. snpToTensor.py
4. snpToTensor.DLpredict.py

Also, please put the directory containing all established DL models (TRAINED_model/) in the parent folder.

To run the prediction model, please use the following command:

python snpToTensor.DLpredict.py <SNP file> <chromosome length file> <genome fasta file> <output file>

where SNP file should contain four columns including chromosomes (MalariaSED only accept autosome ID starting with 'chr'), SNP sites, reference and alternation sequences. 'chromosome length file' is a bed file listing start and end site of each chromosome, while 'genome fasta file' is the fasta sequence information of P.falciparum genome.


Here is a exapmle
python snpToTensor.DLpredict.py example.SNP  ../genome/genome_information_pl9.0.bed ../genome/PlasmoDB-26_Pfalciparum3D7_Genome.fasta aaaaa
