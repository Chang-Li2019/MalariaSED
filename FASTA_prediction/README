This program is designed to predict epigenetic changes between two input Fasta sequences. To successfully run this model, the following package or software are required to be installed.

1.bedtools (>2.30.0)
2.tensorflow (2.4.1)
3.numpy (1.19.5)
4.bisect
5.pickle
6.json

Before runninge prediction model, please put the following files in the same folder
1. genome_2_tensor.py  
2. intergenic.SNP.dl.logRatio.list.hash.pickle
3. snpToTensor.py
4. snpToTensor.DLpredict.py

Also, please put the directory containing all established DL models (TRAINED_model/) in the parent folder.

To run the prediction model, please use the following command:

python snpToTensor.DLpredict.py <Reference_fasta_file>  <Alternation_fasta_file>  <output file>

where <Reference_fasta_file> indicates a fasta file for reference, while <Alternation_fasta_file> for alternate sequence. The sequence length within both of the files should be 1kb, and have the same.
 

Here is a exapmle
python fastaToTensor.DLpredict.py example.REF.fasta example.ALT.fasta outputFile
